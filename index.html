    <p>Hello, my name is Aduragbemi Odukoya. I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. Although I have experience in web design, this is my first degree course in the field. I do have some experience with a functioning website that I created using WordPress, but I hope to learn more from this course and broaden my understanding.</p>
    <p>For the past 15 or 16 years, I have belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I truly appreciate the benefits that result from spreading the good news of Jesus Christ to others.</p>
    <p>I enjoy all things technological, especially those that include websites and games.</p>
    <p>In due course, I hope to get to know everyone and collaborate with you all. I appreciate you visiting my page</p>
